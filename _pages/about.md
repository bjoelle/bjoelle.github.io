I am a computational biologist, specialised in the development and implementation of mathematical models for evolutionary processes. I have worked extensively with Bayesian phylogenetic inference, and contributed to both BEAST2 and RevBayes.

I am interested in birth-death processes, and developed a new model for the inference of lineage-specific birth and death rates from a phylogeny. I have also explored the behaviour of the fossilized birth-death (FBD) process in several simulation studies.

Additionally, I care about improving the reliability and usability of scientific software.  I explore ways to improve both the developer and the user experience, as well as import best practices from other areas of software development.

**Interests:** Bayesian phylogenetic inference, birth-death processes, scientific software

**Programming languages:** Java, C++, R, Python (beginner)

Internships
======

I am happy to supervise master students interested in evolution, paleontology and/or computational biology. A wide range of projects are possible, from model and software development to simulation studies to application to empirical datasets. I also have some smaller projects available for shorter internships.
