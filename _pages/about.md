I am a computational biologist, specialised in the development and implementation of mathematical models for evolutionary processes. I have worked extensively with Bayesian phylogenetic inference, and contributed to both BEAST2 and RevBayes.

I am interested in birth-death processes, and developed a new model for the inference of lineage-specific birth and death rates from a phylogeny. I have also explored the behaviour of the fossilized birth-death (FBD) process in several simulation studies.



**Interests:** Bayesian phylogenetic inference, birth-death processes, scientific software
